ðŸ¦ˆ Bare-bones Snapfish photo downloader.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        Snapfish authentication token.
```

### Retrieving the Authentication Token

1. Extract the `access_token` from the Snapfish website (requires being logged
   in) by opening up the browser's devtools.
2. Navigate to the Network tab.
3. Find and select a JSON response.
4. Locate the response's `access_token` request header (the value should start
   with `OAuth sf_v1a;`).

### Terminology

| Term       | Definition                                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collection | A set of albums from a given month in a given year.       |
| Album      | A named collection of photos. Exists inside a collection. |
| Photo      | A picture. Exists inside an album.                        |

### Output

All output goes to the current working directory (cwd) (which is wherever
snapfish-shark is being run). A folder will be created for each collection;
inside each collection a folder will be created for each album; inside each
album every image will be saved in JPG format.

```

```

### Caveats

-   Because Snapfish album names can contain characters that are invalid in file
    paths, folders created for each album are named using a normalized version
    of the album name.

-   The authentication token may expire while snapchat-shark is running. If the
    program fails with "error connecting to Snapfish", obtain a new token using
    the same process as before.
